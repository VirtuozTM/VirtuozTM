### About me

I enjoy turning complex ideas into simple, smooth, and reliable user experiences.

Some areas I focus on:
- **Animations** â€“ using Reanimated, Skia, or Moti to make interfaces feel alive and fluid  
- **Accessibility** â€“ making sure apps work for everyone with VoiceOver, TalkBack, and proper accessible props  
- **Hardware integrations** â€“ NFC, Bluetooth/BLE, haptics, sensors, and contactless payments  
- **Cross-platform features** â€“ app clips, iOS widgets, Android wearables, and full use of the Expo SDK  
- **Performance** â€“ profiling, optimizing lists and rendering strategies, and keeping apps responsive  
- **Security** â€“ biometrics, secure storage, encryption, and strong authentication flows  
- **Offline-first** â€“ caching, background sync, SQLite/MMKV, and resilient network handling  
- **Developer experience** â€“ clean project setups with Zustand, TanStack Query, React Hook Form, Storybook, and more
